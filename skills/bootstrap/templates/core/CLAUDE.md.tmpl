## Claude Code

- Keep the shared workflow contract in `AGENTS.md`; put Claude-only guidance below this import instead of duplicating the repo rules.
- Project-level Claude Code configuration lives in `.claude/settings.json`. Plugins enabled for this repo are declared under `enabledPlugins`.
- When you add Claude-specific teammates, prefer project subagents under `.claude/agents/`.
- When you need Claude-specific enforcement for teammate creation or completion, prefer project hooks in `.claude/settings.json`.
- First-time marketplace registration on a new machine:

  ```text
  /plugin marketplace add patinaproject/skills
  ```

  After that, the plugins enabled in `.claude/settings.json` are picked up automatically when this repo is opened.
